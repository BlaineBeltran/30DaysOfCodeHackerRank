## Objective
In this challenge, we're getting started with conditional statements. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Tasks
Given an integer,***n***, perform the following conditional actions:
If ***n*** is odd, print Weird
If ***n*** is even and in the inclusive range of **2** to **5**, print Not Weird
If ***n*** is even and in the inclusive range of **6** to **20**, print Weird
If ***n*** is even and greater than **20**, print Not Weird
Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not ***n*** is weird.
## Note:



## Input Format
TA single line containing a positive integer,***n***.

## Output Format
Print the total meal cost, where ***totalCost*** is the rounded integer result of the entire bill (***mealCost*** with added tax and tip).

## Output Format
Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.
## Sample Input
```python
3

```
## Sample Output
```python
Weird
```
## Explanation
Sample Case 0: ***n = 3***.
***n*** is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.
